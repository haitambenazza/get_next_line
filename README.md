# get_next_line
This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
# MANDATORY PART:
    the mandatory part will allow you to read a line from a file per call.
    call the function again and you will read the second line.
    you can define the BUFFER_SIZE to specify how many bites you want to read "-D BUFFER_SIZE=n".
# BONUS PART
    will allow you to read from multi files
